# Creating a new project

## Prerequisites

You'll need:

* **Linux or macOS.**
> WSL might also work but we haven't really tried.
>
> If you're using Fadroma on something more exotic, do get in touch and
> share your experience!

* **Git**, for keeping track of your changes.

* **Docker**, configured to run without `sudo`.
> Fadroma uses Docker to encapsulate builds and launch local devnets.

* **Node.js**, versions >= 16.12
> We prefer the PNPM package manager, because it has the most complete implementation of workspaces.

* **Rust**, stable or nightly.

* **Your preferred code editor.**
> We use NeoVim and VSCode.
