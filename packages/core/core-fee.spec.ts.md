## `Fee`: Specifying per-transaction gas fees

```typescript
import { Fee } from '.'
```

* `client.fee` is the default fee for all transactions
* `client.fees: Record<string, IFee>` is a map of default fees for specific transactions
* `client.withFee(fee: IFee)` allows the caller to override the default fees.
  Calling it returns a new instance of the Client, which talks to the same contract
  but executes all transactions with the specified custom fee.
