## Mocknet

* The Fadroma Mocknet is a pure Node.js implementation of the API and environment that Cosmos
  smart contracts expect.
* Because it does not contain a distributed consensus mechanism,
  it allows the interaction of multiple smart contracts to be tested at a much faster speed than
  devnet.
