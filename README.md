# Getting started

## Create a project and define contracts

```shell
# Create a project:
$ npx @hackbg/fadroma@latest create

# Create a project using a specific version of Fadroma:
$ npx @hackbg/fadroma@1.5.6 create
```

This will create a new project repository with the required dependencies.

```shell
# Add a contract to the project:
$ npm exec fadroma add
```

## Deploy your project

Use the `deploy` command to deploy your project:

```shell
# Deploy your project to a local container:
$ npm exec devnet deploy [...ARGS]

# Deploy your project to testnet:
$ npm exec testnet deploy [...ARGS]

# Deploy your project to mainnet:
$ npm exec mainnet deploy [...ARGS]
```

If deploying fails, you should be able to re-run `deploy` and continue where you left off.

Running `deploy` on a completed deployment will do nothing (unless you've updated the
description of the deployment, in which case it will try to apply the updates).
To deploy everything anew, use `redeploy`:

```shell
# Deploy everything anew:
$ npm exec mainnet redeploy [...ARGS]
```

Deploying a project results in a [deploy receipt](#deploy-receipts) being created -
a simple file containing the state of the deployment. You can have more than one of
these, corresponding to multiple independent deployments of the same code. To see
a list of them, use the `list` command:

```shell
# Select another deployment
$ npm exec mainnet list
```

After a deploy, the newly created deployment will be marked as *active*. To switch
to another deployment, use the `select` command:

```shell
# Select another deployment
$ npm exec mainnet select my-deployment
```

Deployments in YAML multi-document format are human-readable and version control-friendly.
When a list of contracts in JSON is desired, you can use the `export` command to export a JSON
snapshot of the active deployment.

```shell
# Export deployment state to ./my-deployment_@_timestamp.json
$ npm exec fadroma export

# Export deployment state to ./some-directory/my-deployment_@_timestamp.json
$ npm exec fadroma export ./some-directory
```

## Connect to a deployed project

Internally, the data for the export is generated by the
`deployment.snapshot` getter:

```typescript
// TODO
```

In a standard Fadroma project, where the Rust contracts
and TypeScript API client live in the same repo, by `export`ing
the latest mainnet and testnet deployments to JSON files
during the TypeScript build process, and adding them to your
API client package, you can publish an up-to-date "address book"
of your project's active contracts as part of your API client library.

```typescript
// TODO
```

Having been deployed once, contracts may be used continously.
The `Deployment`'s `connect` method loads stored data about
the contracts in the deployment, populating the contained
`Contract` instances.

With the above setup you can automatically connect to
your project in mainnet or testnet mode, depending on
what `Agent` you pass:

```typescript
// TODO
```

Or, to connect to individual contracts from the stored deployment:

```typescript
// TODO
```

## Define custom migrations in a deployment

Migrations can be implemented as static or regular methods
of `Deployment` classes.

```typescript
// TODO
```

## Build individual contracts

```shell
# Build a contract from the project:
$ npm exec fadroma build some-contract

# Build multiple contracts from the project in parallel:
$ npm exec fadroma build some-contract another-contract a-third-contract

# Build all contracts in the project:
$ npm exec fadroma build

# Build contract by path:
$ npm exec fadroma /path/to/crate
```

When deploying, Fadroma automatically builds the `Contract`s specified in the deployment,
using a procedure based on [secret-contract-optimizer](https://hub.docker.com/r/enigmampc/secret-contract-optimizer).

This either with your local Rust/WASM toolchain,
or in a pre-defined [build container](https://github.com/hackbg/fadroma/pkgs/container/fadroma).
The latter option requires Docker (which you also need for the devnet).

By default, optimized builds are output to the `wasm` subdirectory of your project.
Checksums of build artifacts are emitted as `wasm/*.wasm.sha256`: these checksums
should be equal to the code hashes returned by the chain.

We advise you to keep these
**build receipts** in version control. This gives you a quick way to keep track of the
correspondence between changes to source and resulting changes to code hashes.

Furthermore, when creating a `Project`, you'll be asked to define one or more `Template`s
corresponding to the contract crates of your project. You can

Fadroma implements **reproducible compilation** of contracts.
What to compile is specified using the primitives defined in [Fadroma Core](../client/README.md).

## Upload individual contracts

```shell
# Upload a contract:
$ npm exec fadroma upload CONTRACT [...CONTRACT]

# Reupload a contract:
$ fadroma reupload CONTRACT # always reupload
```

Fadroma takes care of **uploading WASM files to get code IDs**. If the same code hash is
known to already be uploaded to the same chain (as represented by
an upload receipt in `state/$CHAIN/uploads/$CODE_HASH.json`,
Fadroma will skip the upload and reuse the existing code ID.

## Deploying to the local devnet

```sh
# Deploy to devnet
$ npm run devnet deploy

# Nuke the devnet
$ npm run devnet reset
```

Fadroma enables fully local development of projects - no remote testnet needed!
This feature is known as **Fadroma Devnet**. 

Normally, you would interact with a devnet no different than any other
`Chain`: through your `Deployment` subclass.

When using the Fadroma CLI, `Chain` instances are provided automatically
to instances `Deployment` subclasses.

So, when `FADROMA_CHAIN` is set to `ScrtDevnet`, your deployment will
be instantiated alongside a local devnet, ready to operate!

As a shortcut, projects created via the Fadroma CLI contain the `devnet`
NPM script, which is an alias to `FADROMA_CHAIN=ScrtDevnet fadroma`.

So, to deploy your project to a local devnet, you would just run:

Fadroma Devnet includes container images based on `localsecret`,
for versions of Secret Network 1.2 to 1.9. Under the hood, the
implementation uses the library [`@hackbg/dock`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hackbg/dock)
to manage Docker images and containers. There is also experimental
support for Podman.

# State

## Build cache

When build caching is enabled, each build call first checks in `FADROMA_ARTIFACTS`
for a corresponding pre-existing build and reuses it if present.

Setting `FADROMA_REBUILD` disables build caching.

## Upload receipts

If contract binaries are not present, the upload command will try to build them first.
Every successful upload logs the transaction as a file called an **upload receipt** under
`state/$CHAIN_ID/upload.`. This contains info about the upload transaction.

The `UploadStore` loads a collection of upload receipts and tells the `Uploader` if a
binary has already been uploaded, so it can prevent duplicate uploads.

## Deploy receipts

Commencing a deployment creates a corresponding file under `state/$CHAIN_ID/deploy`, called
a **deploy receipt**. As contracts are deployed as part of this deployment, their details
will be appended to this file so that they can be found later.

To start over, use the `redeploy` command. This will create and activate a new deployment,
and deploy everything anew.

Keeping receipts of your primary mainnet/testnet deployments in your version control system
will let you keep track of your project's footprint on public networks.

During development, receipts for deployments of a project are kept in a
human- and VCS-friendly YAML format. When publishing an API client,
you may want to include individual deployments as JSON files... TODO

By default, the list of contracts in each deployment created by Fadroma
is stored in `state/${CHAIN_ID}/deploy/${DEPLOYMENT}.yml`.

The deployment currently selected as "active" by the CLI
(usually, the latest created deployment) is symlinked at
`state/${CHAIN_ID}/deploy/.active.yml`.

## Devnet state

Each **devnet** is a stateful local instance of a chain node
(such as `secretd` or `okp4d`), and consists of two things:

1. A container named `fadroma-KIND-ID`, where:

  * `KIND` is what kind of devnet it is. For now, the only valid
    value is `devnet`. In future releases, this will be changed to
    contain the chain name and maybe the chain version.

  * `ID` is a random 8-digit hex number. This way, when you have
    multiple devnets of the same kind, you can distinguish them
    from one another.

  * The name of the container corresponds to the chain ID of the
    contained devnet.

2. State files under `your-project/state/fadroma-KIND-ID/`:

  * `devnet.json` contains metadata about the devnet, such as
    the chain ID, container ID, connection port, and container
    image to use.

  * `wallet/` contains JSON files with the addresses and mnemonics
    of the **genesis accounts** that are created when the devnet
    is initialized. These are the initial holders of the devnet's
    native token, and you can use them to execute transactions.

  * `upload/` and `deploy/` contain **upload and deploy receipts**.
    These work the same as for remote testnets and mainnets,
    and enable reuse of uploads and deployments.

# Scripting

See: [Fadroma Agent API](./agent/README.md)

## Build API

* **BuildRaw**: runs the build in the current environment
* **BuildContainer**: runs the build in a container for enhanced reproducibility

### Getting a builder

#### BuildContainer

By default, you get a `BuildContainer`,
which runs the build procedure in a container
provided by either Docker or Podman (as selected
by the `FADROMA_BUILD_PODMAN` environment variable).

`BuildContainer` uses [`@hackbg/dock`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hackbg/dock) to
operate the container engine.

Use `FADROMA_DOCKER` or the `dockerSocket` option to specify a non-default Docker socket path.

The `BuildContainer` runs the build procedure defined by the `FADROMA_BUILD_SCRIPT`
in a container based on the `FADROMA_BUILD_IMAGE`, resulting in optimized WASM build artifacts
being output to the `FADROMA_ARTIFACTS` directory.

#### BuildRaw

If you want to execute the build procedure in your
current environment, you can switch to `BuildRaw`
by passing `raw: true` or setting `FADROMA_BUILD_RAW`.

### Building a contract

Now that we've obtained a `Builder`, let's compile a contract from source into a WASM binary.

#### Building a named contract from the project

Building asynchronously returns `Template` instances.
A `Template` is an undeployed contract. You can upload
it once, and instantiate any number of `Contract`s from it.

To build a single crate with the builder:

To build multiple crates in parallel:

For built contracts, the following holds true:

* Build result will contain code hash and path to binary:

* Build result will contain info about build inputs:

The above holds true equally for contracts produced
by `BuildContainer` and `BuildRaw`.

#### Specifying a contract to build

The `Template` and `Contract` classes have the following properties for specifying the source:

|field|type|description|
|-|-|-|
|**`repository`**|Path or URL|Points to the Git repository containing the contract sources. This is all you need if your smart contract is a single crate.|
|**`workspace`**|Path or URL|Cargo workspace containing the contract sources. May or may not be equal to `contract.repo`. May be empty if the contract is a single crate.|
|**`crate`**|string|Name of the Cargo crate containing the individual contract source. Required if `contract.workspace` is set.|
|**`revision`**|string|Git reference (branch or tag). Defaults to `HEAD`, otherwise builds a commit from history.|

The outputs of builds are called **artifact**s, and are represented by two properties:

|field|type|description|
|-|-|-|
|**`artifact`**|URL|Canonical location of the compiled binary.|
|**`codeHash`**|string|SHA256 checksum of artifact. should correspond to **template.codeHash** and **instance.codeHash** properties of uploaded and instantiated contracts|

### Building past commits of contracts

* `DotGit`, a helper for finding the contents of Git history
  where Git submodules are involved. This works in tandem with
  `build.impl.mjs` to enable:
  * **building any commit** from a project's history, and therefore
  * **pinning versions** for predictability during automated one-step deployments.

If `.git` directory is present, builders can check out and build a past commits of the repo,
as specifier by `contract.revision`.

### The build procedure

The ultimate build procedure, i.e. actual calls to `cargo` and such,
is implemented in the standalone script `FADROMA_BUILD_SCRIPT` (default: `build.impl.mjs`),
which is launched by the builders.

### Builders

The subclasses of the abstract base class `Builder` in Fadroma Core
implement the compilation procedure for contracts.

Checksums of compiled contracts by version are stored in the build state
directory, `wasm/`.

### Upload API

The client package, `@fadroma/agent`, exposes a base `Uploader` class,
which the global `fetch` method to obtain code from any supported URL
(`file:///` or otherwise).

This `fetch`-based implementation only supports temporary, in-memory
upload caching: if you ask it to upload the same contract many times,
it will upload it only once - but it will forget all about that
as soon as you refresh the page.

The backend package, `@hackbg/fadroma`, provides `FSUploader`.
This extension of `Uploader` uses Node's `fs` API instead, and
writes upload receipts into the upload state directory for the
given chain (e.g. `state/$CHAIN/uploads/`).

Let's try uploading an example WASM binary:

* Uploading with default configuration (from environment variables):

* Passing custom options to the uploader:

## Devnet API

### Creating the devnet

When scripting with the Fadroma API outside of the standard CLI/deployment
context, you can use the `getDevnet` method to configure and obtain a `Devnet`
instance.

`getDevnet` supports the following options; their default values can be
set through environment variables.

At this point you have prepared a *description* of a devnet.
To actually launch it, use the `create` then the `start` method:

At this point, you should have a devnet container running,
its state represented by files in your project's `state/` directory.

To operate on the devnet thus created, you will need to wrap it
in a **Chain** object and obtain the usual **Agent** instance.

For this, the **Devnet** class has the **getChain** method.

A `Chain` object which represents a devnet has the following additional API:

|name|description|
|-|-|
|**chain.mode**|**ChainMode**: `"Devnet"` when the chain in question is a devnet|
|**chain.isDevnet**|**boolean:** `true` when the chain in question is a devnet|
|**chain.devnet**|**DevnetHandle**: allows devnet internals to be controlled from your script|
|**chain.devnet.running**|**boolean**: `true` if the devnet container is running|
|**chain.devnet.start()**|**()⇒Promise\<this\>**: starts the devnet container|
|**chain.devnet.getAccount(name)**|**(string)⇒Promise\<Partial\<Agent\>\>**: returns info about a genesis account|
|**chain.devnet.assertPresence()**|**()⇒Promise\<void\>**: throws if the devnet container ID is known, but the container itself is not found|

### Devnet accounts

Devnet state is independent from the state of mainnet or testnet.
That means existing wallets and faucets don't exist. Instead, you
have access to multiple **genesis accounts**, which are provided
with initial balance to cover gas costs for your contracts.

When getting an **Agent** on the devnet, use the `name` property
to specify which genesis account to use. Default genesis account
names are `Admin`, `Alice`, `Bob`, `Charlie`, and `Mallory`.

This will populate the created Agent with the mnemonic for that
genesis account.

That's it! You are now set to use the standard Fadroma Agent API
to operate on the local devnet as the specified identity.

#### Custom devnet accounts

You can also specify custom genesis accounts by passing an array
of account names to the `accounts` parameter of the **getDevnet**
function.

### Pausing the devnet

You can pause the devnet by stopping the container:

### Exporting a devnet snapshot

An exported devnet snapshot is a great way to provide a
standardized development build of your project. For example,
you can use one to test the frontend/contracts stack as a
step of your integration pipeline.

To create a snapshot, use the **export** method of the **Devnet** class:

When the active chain is a devnet, the `export` command,
which exports a list of contracts in the current deployment,
also saves the current state of the devnet as **a new container image**.

```sh
$ npm run devnet export
```

### Cleaning up

Devnets are local-only and thus temporary.

To delete an individual devnet, the **Devnet** class
provides the **delete** method. This will stop and remove
the devnet container, then delete all devnet state in your
project's state directory.

To delete all devnets in a project, the **Project** class
provides the **resetDevnets** method:

The to call **resetDevnets** from the command line, use the
`reset` command:

```sh
$ npm run devnet reset
```
