"I was always willing to be reasonable until I had to be unreasonable.
 Sometimes reasonable men must do unreasonable things."

**A portable development environment** improves
the accessibility and reliability of interacting
with WASM-based blockchains.

**A toolkit of reusable smart contract primitives**
makes it easier to build and deploy smart contracts,
thus advancing the technological state of the WASM
blockchain ecosystem, and thus its economic viability.

"The reasonable man adapts himself to the world;
 the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself.
 Therefore, all progress depends on the unreasonable man."
