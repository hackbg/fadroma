"I was always willing to be reasonable until I had to be unreasonable.
 Sometimes reasonable men must do unreasonable things."

"The reasonable man adapts himself to the world;
 the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself.
 Therefore, all progress depends on the unreasonable man."
                                    - George Bernard Shaw
