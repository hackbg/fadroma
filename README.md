## Creating a project

### Creating a Fadroma project with NPM

If you have Node.js set up, you can use `npm init` to create a new Fadroma project:

```sh
$ npm init @fadroma
```

This will run the `fadroma project create` command,
which will ask you a few questions and create a mixed NPM/Cargo project.

### Creating a Fadroma project with Nix

If you use Nix, you can create a project with:

```sh
$ nix-shell https://fadroma.tech/nix -c fadroma project create
```

Projects are created with a `shell.nix` which you can enter with:

```sh
$ nix-shell /my/project
```

Or, if you're already at the root of the project:

```sh
$ nix-shell
```

## Standalone Nix shell

```sh
$ nix-shell https://fadroma.tech/nix
```

This contains Node, Rust, build utilities,
and a `fadroma` command in the `PATH`.

## Exploring onward

Now you are ready to write your first smart contract, deploy it,
and integrate it with the wider Internet-of-Blockchains.
