# Writing smart contracts with Fadroma DSL

The `fadroma-dsl` crate defines a simple procedural macro-based DSL that
helps you write composable, boilerplate-free CosmWasm contracts.

Fadroma DSL sets out to achieve two main goals:

* **Brevity.** Repetitive code that you'd otherwise write manually is generated automatically
  in a structured way.

* **Composability.** The procedural macro provides a reliable and flexible system for composing
  common smart contract functionality and extending contracts. Individual high-level features,
  such as admin functionality, can easily be added to a smart contract, reused and extended as
  needed. The granularity of this extends to the individual functions. Furthermore, dependencies
  between Fadroma DSL-based features can be defined and enforced.

Any misuse of the macro will result in simple **compile errors** -- not some hidden or unexpected
runtime behavior. Additionally, the macro error messages should tell you exactly what you need to
add or change in order for it to compile.

### Prerequisites

Using Fadroma DSL assumes you're familiar with the general architecture and operational model
of CosmWasm smart contracts.

### Examples

For a quick comparison of DSL-based code vs. "raw" CosmWasm, see [Comparison](#comparison).

See also: the [`examples`](https://github.com/hackbg/fadroma/tree/master/examples)
directory in the Fadroma repo. These examples showcase how to use the DSL and the pre-defined
DSL-based features in Fadroma. Furthermode, the DSL-based features can be used in non-DSL contracts.

## Usage

### Attribute macros

The DSL has the following attributes defined:

**Note that you don't you don't have to remember all the attributes and
rules around them because the compiler will guide you.**

#### **`contract`**

Only valid for `mod` items. The `mod` will contain the entire implementation of your contract.
It generates a zero-sized `Contract` struct which you **must** use to implement the contract
methods as well as any interfaces that you wish. All methods marked with any of the `#[init]`,
`#[execute]` or `#[query]` attributes will be included as part of the available functionality
that the contract exposes. Though, you are free to write any other `Contract` methods or functions
inside the module as well. Interfaces are implemented for the contract using the standard Rust
syntax i.e `impl MyTrait for Contract { ... }` where `MyTrait` is a trait declared with the
`#[interface]` attribute. Technically you can use any trait that satisfies the types that
`#[interface]` requires and it won't break anything since the macro enforces that. The macro
also generates an `Error` enum that represents all possible errors that you use across your
contract and the interfaces that it implements. This is used in the generated `execute` and
`query` functions but rather an implementation detail that ties everything together. On
the other hand, it's there if you want to use it for anything.

#### **`interface`**

Unless you have multiple contracts that talk to each other, you don't need this attribute and can
just use `#[contract]`. But when that is the case, this attribute allows to define the interface of
your contract separately and generate its `InstantiateMsg` (if present), `ExecuteMsg` and `QueryMsg`.
This means that the interface can be defined in a separate crate and can be consumed by multiple
other crates that implement a contract. This approach plays well with the common pattern of defining
all contract messages in a single crate and having the contract crates use that to implement and call
eachother. In addition, having to implement the interface trait in your contract means that Rust will
never let the interface and implementation go out of sync. The interfaces forces you to declare the
associated type `type Error: std::fmt::Display;` and all methods must return that as an error type.
This is allows to have a custom error type. Otherwise, just use `cosmwasm_std::StdError`.

#### **`init`**

The instantiate method for the contract. There can be only one per contract but each interface
that your contract implements must have it as well if it has it defined. Can be omitted altogether
both in `#[contract]` and `#[interface]` contexts. When used in the latter, it will simply generate
an `InstantiateMsg` struct. In the former it only serves as a marker inside any implemented
interfaces unless the `entry` meta argument is used.

##### Meta arguments

- `entry`
  - Used as `#[init(entry)]` and creates the `InstantiateMsg`, `ExecuteMsg` and `QueryMsg` structs,
    the `instantiate`, `execute` and `query` entry point functions.
  - Is optional.
  - Can only be used in `#[contract]`.
  - Only a single `#[init]` can be marked with it and this includes any interfaces that
    the contract implements.
  - If you have an `#[init]` attribute in one of your contract methods (inside the
    `impl Contract` block) you must add this attribute. The reasoning for this being that since
    this is what generates the message enums and entry functions, having an `#[init]` attribute in
    a contract method (but not in interface methods) without it would basically do nothing.

- `entry_wasm`
  - Generates the same boilerplate and has the same rules as the `entry` meta
    but will also generate the WASM boilerplate FFI module.

#### **`execute`**

A method that is part of the executable set of methods of the contract.
Each method that is to be part of that set must be annotated with that.
The generated `ExecuteMsg` enum is comprised of the names of all those methods.
Dispatch also happens automatically through the generated `execute` functions.
This is all code that you'd write yourself.

#### **`query`**

Identical to how the `#[execute]` attribute works but generated
the `QueryMsg` enum and the `query` function.

#### **`reply`**

Marks the method as a CosmWasm reply handler. Only **one** such function can exist per contract
and it must have a single parameter with the `cosmwasm_std::Reply` type.

#### **`execute_guard`**
An execute guard function is a special function that is called before matching the `ExecuteMsg`
enum inside the `execute` function both of which are generated by the macro. Only **one** such
function can exist per contract and it must have a single parameter with the `&ExecuteMsg` type.

It is useful in cases where we want to assert some state before proceeding with executing the
incoming message and fail before that if necessary. For [example](https://github.com/hackbg/fadroma/blob/master/examples/derive-contract-components/src/lib.rs#L24-L38),
it should be used with Fadroma's killswitch component. Inside the execute guard we check whether
the contract is pausing or migrated and return an `Err(())` if so.

#### **`auto_impl`**

Only valid for trait `impl` blocks. It takes a path to a struct which implements the given
interface trait being implemented. For each method that is part of the trait, it delegates the
implementation to the given struct. We ensure that the provided struct exactly implements the
trait by using Rust's fully qualified syntax (`<MyStruct as Trait>::method_name()`). It will also
fill in the concrete `Error` type that the interface must have. You delegate the implementation to
the struct by leaving the method body **completely** empty. Otherwise, writing a method body will
use your code. This allows for great flexibility since you can implement an interface by using an 
existing implementation while allowing you to directly override any methods that you wish. For 
example:

```rust ignore
#[auto_impl(ImplementingStuct)]
impl MyInterface for Contract {
  // Here we leave the body empty and it will delegate the implementation to ImplementingStuct
  #[execute]
  fn first_method(some_arg: u32) -> Result<Response, Self::Error> {
    // The macro inserts the following code here
    // <ImplementingStuct as MyInterface>::first_method(deps, env, info, some_arg)
  }

  // Here we provide our own implementation so ImplementingStuct is not used at all.
  #[execute]
  fn second_method() -> Result<Response, Self::Error> {
    Ok(Response::default())
  }
}
```

#### Meta arguments

  - Path to the struct that implements the trait
  - Not optional.

The ubiquitous `Deps`/`DepsMut`, `Env` and `MessageInfo` types are automatically added
to generated method signatures, so that they don't need to be specified all the time.

Parameters that your message declares are appended after those in the method signature.
The following table describes which attribute includes what parameters:

|Attribute       |Generated signature                                    |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
|#[init]         |`deps: DepsMut, env: Env, info: MessageInfo, ...msg`   |
|#[execute]      |`deps: DepsMut, env: Env, info: MessageInfo, ...msg`   |
|#[query]        |`deps: Deps, env: Env, ...msg`                         |
|#[reply]        |`deps: DepsMut, env: Env, ...msg`                      |
|#[execute_guard]|`deps: DepsMut, env: &Env, info: &MessageInfo, ...msg` |

## Comparison

To better understand what the macro generates, here's a simple contract:

```rust ignore
#[fadroma::dsl::contract]
pub mod counter_contract {
    use fadroma::{
        dsl::*,
        admin::{self, Admin, Mode},
        schemars,
        cosmwasm_std::{self, Response, Addr, StdError}
    };

    impl Contract {
        #[init(entry_wasm)]
        pub fn new(initial_value: u64) -> Result<Response, StdError> {
            Ok(Response::default())
        }
        #[execute]
        pub fn add(value: u64) -> Result<Response, StdError> {
            Ok(Response::default())
        }
        #[query]
        pub fn value() -> Result<u64, StdError> {
            Ok(0)
        }
    }

    #[auto_impl(admin::DefaultImpl)]
    impl Admin for Contract {
        #[execute]
        fn change_admin(mode: Option<Mode>) -> Result<Response, Self::Error> { }
        #[query]
        fn admin() -> Result<Option<Addr>, Self::Error> { }
    }
}
```

And here's what the expanded code ends up looking like:

```rust ignore
pub mod counter_contract {
    use fadroma::{
        dsl::*,
        admin::{self, Admin, Mode},
        schemars,
        cosmwasm_std::{self, Response, Addr, StdError}
    };

    #[derive(Clone, Copy)]
    pub struct Contract;

    impl Contract {
        pub fn new(
            mut deps: cosmwasm_std::DepsMut,
            env: cosmwasm_std::Env,
            info: cosmwasm_std::MessageInfo,
            initial_value: u64,
        ) -> Result<Response, StdError> {
            Ok(Response::default())
        }

        pub fn add(
            mut deps: cosmwasm_std::DepsMut,
            env: cosmwasm_std::Env,
            info: cosmwasm_std::MessageInfo,
            value: u64,
        ) -> Result<Response, StdError> {
            Ok(Response::default())
        }

        pub fn value(
            deps: cosmwasm_std::Deps,
            env: cosmwasm_std::Env
        ) -> Result<u64, StdError> {
            Ok(0)
        }
    }

    impl Admin for Contract {
        type Error = <admin::DefaultImpl as Admin>::Error;

        fn change_admin(
            mut deps: cosmwasm_std::DepsMut,
            env: cosmwasm_std::Env,
            info: cosmwasm_std::MessageInfo,
            mode: Option<Mode>,
        ) -> Result<Response, Self::Error> {
            <admin::DefaultImpl as Admin>::change_admin(deps, env, info, mode)
        }
        fn admin(
            deps: cosmwasm_std::Deps,
            env: cosmwasm_std::Env,
        ) -> Result<Option<Addr>, Self::Error> {
            <admin::DefaultImpl as Admin>::admin(deps, env)
        }
    }
